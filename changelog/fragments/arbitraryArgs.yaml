      Added the "--ansible-args" command-line flag that allows users to specify arbitrary
      CLI arguments for ansible-based operators that are passed through ansible-runner.
      For example, passing --ansible-vault as an arbitrary argument allows the user to store
      sensitive data in encrypted files.
